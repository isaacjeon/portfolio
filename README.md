# Tableau Dashboards

### Brazilian E-Commerce

Tools: SQL, Tableau

This project explores the **Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist** from Kaggle, involving order data across several dimensions including customer and seller demographics, product categories, payment types, delivery logistics, and review scores. It utilizes **MySQL** for data structuring, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA), and **Tableau** for building interactive dashboards for visualizing monthly sales performance, regional trends, delivery times, and customer purchasing behavior and satisfaction to uncover operational and marketing insights.

Tools: SQL, Tableau

This project visualizes and analyzes Japan tourism data on a regional level collected across various categories (e.g., Accommodation Type, Nationality, Length of Stay). The goal is to identify characteristics of tourists that visit each region of Japan, which may provide some insight into which demographics each region may or may not appeal to and can allow for more informative tourism advertising such as in promotion of travel services and attractions. The original data was provided as a single **Excel** file with multiple sheets. After cleaning and restructuring in Google Sheets, the data was imported as multiple tables into **MySQL** that were unified and prepared for interactive exploration using **Tableau**.
