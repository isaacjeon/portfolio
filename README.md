## Tableau Dashboards

### Brazilian E-Commerce
- Tools: SQL, Tableau
- Links: <a href="https://github.com/isaacjeon/brazilian_ecommerce" target="_blank">Github Repository</a>, <a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/BrazilianE-Commerce_17547219521680/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link" target="_blank">Tableau Public Dashboard</a><br>

This project explores Brazilian e-commerce order data across several dimensions including customer and seller demographics, product categories, payment types, delivery logistics, and review scores. It utilizes **MySQL** for data structuring, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA), and **Tableau** for building interactive dashboards for visualizing monthly sales performance, regional trends, delivery times, and customer purchasing behavior and satisfaction to uncover operational and marketing insights.

### Japan Tourism
- Tools: SQL, Tableau
- Links: <a href="https://github.com/isaacjeon/japan-tourism-segmentation" target="_blank">Github Repository</a>, <a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/JapanTourismbyPrefectureRegion/Dashboard?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link" target="_blank">Tableau Public Dashboard</a><br>

This project builds a dashboard for visualization of Japan tourism data on a regional level collected across various categories (e.g., Accommodation Type, Nationality, Length of Stay. The original Excel file was cleaned and restructured, before importing the data into MySQL. The tables were then unified and prepared for exploration using Tableau. The interactive dashboard enables identification and filtering of characteristics of tourists that visit each region of Japan, which may provide some insight into which demographics each region may or may not appeal to and can allow for more informative tourism advertising such as in promotion of travel services and attractions.
